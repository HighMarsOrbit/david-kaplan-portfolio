    description:
      "This year, for CWRU Motorsports, I am designing the front hub, one of the highest-loaded parts on the car. Thanks to my new decision to move wheel bearings inboard, we managed to cut the weight of the front hub down by more than 15% with no performance downside, significantly improving our car's handling.",

    description:
      "For the CWRU Motorsports team, I designed and developed shrouding for the CVT. This cover was designed to protect drivers and workers in case of a sudden catastrophic failure of the CVT, which would cause pieces to fly out at high velocity. The CVT Cover also had to stay firmly affixed to the car during severe driving loads.",

    description:
      "For Lincoln Electric, I designed and assembled a flex test stand for their new line of EV Cables. I designed the flex tester to be robust, since their existing tester kept breaking, and flexible, in order to accommodate various types of EV charger connections. I designed the test stand to mimic the normal flexures a cable sees while in use.",
